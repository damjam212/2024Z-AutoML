    "## Tool Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### Folder Structure:\n",
    "- `data/` - Input data\n",
    "- `medaid/` - Source code of the tool\n",
    "- `tests/` - Unit tests\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Processing Flow:\n",
    "### The MedAId package consists of three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Processing** (`preprocessing/`): This component handles loading the data, cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. It also handles any missing values and normalizes numerical features. The preprocessing step ensures that the data is ready for model training by transforming it into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modeling** (`training/`): This component focuses on creating classification models, training them, evaluating and comparing their performance, and saving the models to files. It includes model selection (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines), hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC. The best-performing model is selected and saved for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Result Interpretation** (`reporting/`): This component generates visualizations of the model results, creates comprehensive reports, performs SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) analysis for model interpretability, and compares various metrics to help users understand the model's decision-making process. It includes graphs like ROC curves, confusion matrices, feature importance plots, and detailed model performance summaries.\n"

    "### `preprocessing/`\n",
    "The module responsible for the comprehensive data processing pipeline, which includes the following steps: handling numerical formats, removing text columns, imputing missing data, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling. This class integrates various data processing components into a single pipeline, allowing for simultaneous management of all required stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `preprocessing.py`\n",
    "#### Data Processing Stages:\n",
    "1. **Handling Numerical Formats**  \n",
    "   The function `handle_numeric_format()` in the `NumericCommaHandler` class handles converting numbers formatted with commas (e.g., `1,000`) into the standard numeric format.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Removing Text Columns**  \n",
    "   The `ColumnRemover` class is used to identify and remove text columns based on specified thresholds (e.g., when missing data in a column exceeds a predefined limit).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Imputation of Missing Data**  \n",
    "   The imputation function relies on various methods, such as linear regression (in the `Imputer` class) and Random Forest. Correlation thresholds are set to use appropriate imputation algorithms depending on the correlation of columns with other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Encoding Categorical Variables**  \n",
    "   Categorical variables, including the target column, are encoded by the `Encoder` class using different encoding methods, including `LabelEncoder` and `OneHotEncoder`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Feature Scaling**  \n",
    "   The `scale()` function in the `Scaler` class scales numerical columns in the DataFrame. Depending on the data distribution (normal or skewed), standardization (for normal distribution) or normalization (for skewed distribution) is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Functions of the `Preprocessing` Class:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`__init__(target_column, path, imputer_lr_correlation_threshold, imputer_rf_correlation_threshold, categorical_threshold, removal_correlation_threshold)`**:  \n",
    "    Initializes the class object by setting parameters such as the target column, correlation thresholds, and other configuration options. It also creates instances of the appropriate processing components like `NumericCommaHandler`, `ColumnRemover`, `Encoder`, `Scaler`, `Imputer`, and `PreprocessingCsv`.\n",
    "    **Parameter Descriptions:**\n",
    "    - `target_column` (str): The name of the target column.\n",
    "    - `path` (str): The directory path where processing details will be saved.\n",
    "    - `imputer_lr_correlation_threshold` (float): The correlation threshold for imputation using linear regression.\n",
    "    - `imputer_rf_correlation_threshold` (float): The correlation threshold for imputation using Random Forest.\n",
    "    - `categorical_threshold` (float): The threshold for considering a column as text, which is not categorical. It is based on the ratio of unique values to all values; if higher than the threshold, the column is treated as text and removed.\n",
    "    - `removal_correlation_threshold` (float): The correlation threshold for removing highly correlated columns (excluding the target column). Only one column from correlated groups is retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`preprocess(dataframe)`**:  \n",
    "    The main processing function that performs all pipeline steps. It takes a DataFrame as input, processes it through each stage, and returns the processed DataFrame. After each stage, it logs processing details such as text column removal, imputation, encoding, and scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`get_column_info()`**:  \n",
    "    Returns details about the processing for each column, including information on removed columns, imputation methods, encoding, and scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`save_column_info(text_column_removal_info, imputation_info, encoding_info, scaling_info)`**:  \n",
    "    Saves processing details to a CSV file. This function uses the `PreprocessingCsv` class to store information about removed columns, imputation, encoding, and scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`get_target_encoding_info()`**:  \n",
    "    Returns information about the encoding method used for the target column.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Details of Implementation of Individual Components:\n",
